Django backend project showcasing REST APIs, PostgreSQL, and AWS setup for FreJun internship.

# Backend Engineer Intern Project – FreJun

## 📌 Overview

This is a backend web application developed as part of the Backend Engineer Intern assessment for **FreJun**. It demonstrates core backend engineering capabilities using the Django framework, Django REST Framework, PostgreSQL integration (optional), AWS readiness, and more.

---

## ✅ Features Implemented

- ✅ Django-based backend application setup
- ✅ RESTful APIs using Django REST Framework
- ✅ Modular app structure
- ✅ SQLite support for quick development and testing
- ✅ User authentication (Django admin)
- ✅ CRUD operations via API
- ✅ AWS configuration placeholders (for S3/static/media)

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations / What Was Not Done

- ❌ PostgreSQL was **not installed locally** due to repeated installation issues (installer was in Chinese and failed to proceed).
- ❌ AWS services are **not live-configured** but placeholders are added for future deployment.
- ❌ Project is not deployed live (since AWS and PostgreSQL were blocked by setup issues on local machine).

> Despite these, the project is fully functional using SQLite and follows good backend engineering practices.
