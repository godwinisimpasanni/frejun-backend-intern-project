# Backend Engineer Intern Project ‚Äì FreJun

## üìå Overview

This is a backend web application developed as part of the Backend Engineer Intern assessment for **FreJun**. It demonstrates core backend engineering capabilities using the Django framework, Django REST Framework, PostgreSQL integration (optional), AWS readiness, and more.

---

## ‚úÖ Features Implemented

- ‚úÖ Django-based backend application setup
- ‚úÖ RESTful APIs using Django REST Framework
- ‚úÖ Modular app structure
- ‚úÖ SQLite support for quick development and testing
- ‚úÖ User authentication (Django admin)
- ‚úÖ CRUD operations via API
- ‚úÖ AWS configuration placeholders (for S3/static/media)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations / What Was Not Done

- ‚ùå PostgreSQL was **not installed locally** due to repeated installation issues (installer was in Chinese and failed to proceed).
- ‚ùå AWS services are **not live-configured** but placeholders are added for future deployment.
- ‚ùå Project is not deployed live (since AWS and PostgreSQL were blocked by setup issues on local machine).

> Despite these, the project is fully functional using SQLite and follows good backend engineering practices.
